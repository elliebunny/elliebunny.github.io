<div id="about_me" markdown="1" class="section">

Through a variety of analytical, business development, and cross-departmental roles, I have been fortunate enough to gain insight into what I believe is a well-rounded, dynamic, and forward-thinking view into the creation of successful campaigns and unbeaten strategies. Responsibility is a feature I have always excelled in managing, paired with my reliability, I have been trusted to take initiative and leadership in both professional and personal environments. Currently, I am working as a Business Analyst (Manager) for EXCEL Esports, a leading UK esports organization, where I am responsible for the organization’s data strategy, analysis, and reporting which aid in guiding key business decisions.

I also have an interest in computing and technology, [building my own PC](https://imgur.com/59Fgf1N), which I use for gaming, design, and streaming, as well as recently teaching myself to code.

From 2015 to 2018, I was appointed president of the Bristol Donors Society at the University of Bristol, helping to raise awareness of the importance of donating blood as well as recruiting and supporting first-time donors.
