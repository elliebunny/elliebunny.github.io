Passionate, motivated, and creatively minded, over the past 7 years I have held a variety of roles in the sectors of Business Development, Pastoral Care, Hospitality, Administration, and Sales.

> As Business Development Executive for Bristol SU, I am responsible for managing commercial media sales. I coordinate commercial bookings for our Welcome Fair taking place in September/October, in which over 13,000 University of Bristol students attended our physical fair in 2019, and over 8,000 students at our digital fair in 2020. Additionally, I organise our year-round advertising opportunities, whether this is through SOLUS emails, digital screens, or brand activation here at the Richmond Building when COVID-19 guidelines permit.

You can view our advertisement opportunities and download our 2020 media sales pack [here](https://www.bristolsu.org.uk/commercial/digital).
