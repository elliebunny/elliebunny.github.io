## **Personal Profile**

Through a variety of academic, business, and pastoral roles, I have been fortunate enough to gain insight into what I believe is a well-rounded, dynamic, and forward-thinking view into what makes a valuable and successful business. Responsibility is a feature I have always excelled in managing, paired with my reliability, I have been trusted to take initiative and leadership in both professional and personal environments. I strive to become an asset to any new team, both social and professional and pride myself on my organisation, problem-solving and flexibility. After graduating from the University of Bristol with a degree in Mathematics and Philosophy, I am now applying my skills in logical reasoning, data analysis, and communication, to pursue a career in business development and marketing. 
Passionate, motivated, and creatively minded, over the past 7 years I have held a variety of roles in the sectors of Business Development, Pastoral Care, Hospitality, Administration, and Sales.

It has been a real honour working for such a prestigious company and being a representative for the Tom Howley brand.

I was formerly president of the Bristol Donors society at the University of Bristol, helping to raise awareness of the importance of donating blood as well as recruiting new blood and organ donors. Over three years, I managed to build up the societyâ€™s membership as well as training the new committee to take over. I also have an interest in computing and technology, building my own PC, which I use for gaming, design and editing. My love for music has seen me take up singing and playing the guitar, which I practice and record in my spare time.
