### **Personal Profile**

Through a variety of academic, business, and pastoral roles, I have been fortunate enough to gain insight into what I believe is a well-rounded, dynamic, and forward-thinking view into what makes a valuable and successful business. Responsibility is a feature I have always excelled in managing, paired with my reliability, I have been trusted to take initiative and leadership in both professional and personal environments. I strive to become an asset to any new team, both social and professional and pride myself on my organisation, problem-solving and flexibility. After graduating from the University of Bristol with a degree in Mathematics and Philosophy, I am now applying my skills in logical reasoning, data analysis, and communication, to pursue a career in business development and marketing. 
Passionate, motivated, and creatively minded, over the past 7 years I have held a variety of roles in the sectors of Business Development, Pastoral Care, Hospitality, Administration, and Sales.
